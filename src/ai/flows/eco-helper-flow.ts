**Key Features of Gemini AI**

**1. Multimodal Intelligence**
Gemini can seamlessly process and generate across text, images, audio, video, code, and more. That means you can show it an image to ask questions, speak to it, or even feed video—all within one conversation flow.

**2. Tiered Model Sizes**
- Gemini Ultra: Top-tier model for complex tasks; best-in-class benchmark performance.
- Gemini Pro: Mid-tier balance of performance and efficiency.
- Gemini Nano: Small, on-device model (e.g. for Pixel phones).

**3. Advanced Reasoning & Performance**
Gemini Ultra surpasses GPT-4 on benchmarks like MMLU, Big-Bench Hard, GSM8K (math), and HumanEval (coding).

**4. Coding Support**
Gemini can generate, explain, translate, and debug code across languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. It retains context and supports large coding projects with efficiency.

**5. Creative Generation Tools**
- Veo 2: Create high-resolution, 8-second videos from text prompts (available in Gemini Advanced).
- Canvas: An interactive workspace where you can draft, edit, refine text or code interactively.
- Audio Overviews: Converts documents into podcast-style audio summaries with AI "hosts."

**6. Gemini Live**
Engage in natural, uninterrupted voice or video conversations—even show your surroundings to Gemini in real-time. It understands visual context and responds dynamically.

**7. Image Editing—Nano Banana**
The “Nano Banana” tool lets you perform powerful edits—like outfit changes, object insertions, color corrections, or surreal transformations—in seconds with realistic outcomes.

**8. Deep Research & Agentic Features**
- Deep Research: Synthesizes comprehensive, annotated reports from the web in minutes.
- Project Mariner (Agent Mode): Can navigate the web to shop, fill forms, and perform tasks autonomously.

**9. Gemini Drops & Google App Integration**
Frequent updates via "Gemini drops" introduce features like:
- Gems: Custom AI assistants for your recurring tasks.
- Search enhancements: Agentic calling and Circle to Search for interactive queries.
- Wearables integration, real-time captions, and sound-enabled video (Veo 3).

**10. Smart Home & Automotive Integration**
- Google Home / Nest: Gemini will fully replace Google Assistant starting October 1, 2025, enabling seamless smart home control with natural conversation and device multitasking.
- Android Auto: Embedded in cars to help send messages, set reminders, search, and have extended voice interactions without phone use.
